This project implements a simple artificial neural network (ANN) from scratch using NumPy.
The code defines an ANN class with manually implemented feedforward, sigmoid activation, MSE loss, and backpropagation without external ML libraries. 
Randomized synthetic features such as height, weight, eye color, and hair color are created to simulate inputs. 
Before training, a separate manual forward pass is demonstrated, then the ANN is trained until the error drops below a threshold.
