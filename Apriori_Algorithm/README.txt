This code fetches a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and prepares it for data mining tasks by handling missing values and converting features into a binary format. It then applies the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on confidence thresholds. Finally, it computes simplified TF-IDF–like scores for features and saves all results (frequent itemsets, association rules, and TF-IDF scores) into CSV files for further analysis or reporting.
