This code performs a full workflow for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis, starting from loading a ready-to-use ECG dataset to detecting and classifying key cardiac waveform components. It applies moving average smoothing to reduce noise, then uses peak detection techniques to identify R, P, Q, S, and T points in the signal. Finally, it separates normal and abnormal peaks and computes temporal differences between waveform components to support further cardiac rhythm analysis.
