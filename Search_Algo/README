This project implements classic search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem.
The State class represents the puzzle board, tracks the blank tile, and generates valid moves.
Node stores the search tree structure and reconstructs the solution path.
Problem defines initial and goal states, while BFS, DFS, and IDS explore the state space differently.
The final section runs all algorithms on the same puzzle and prints comparative results.
