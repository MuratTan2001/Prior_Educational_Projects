This code implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict a target variable from indoor sensor data using linear regression.
The dataset is read from an Excel file, converted to CSV, split into training, validation, and test sets, and standardized before modeling.
A sliding window approach is applied to capture temporal dependencies, and model performance is evaluated using R², MAE, and residual analysis plots.
The explanation first focuses on how the data is imported, cleaned, and organized into meaningful input, output, and auxiliary columns.
It then describes the use of scaling and a sliding window technique to transform time-series data into a supervised learning format 
suitable for linear regression.
Finally, it explains how the model is trained, evaluated on multiple datasets, and analyzed through residual plots and statistical 
measures to assess prediction quality and error distribution.
