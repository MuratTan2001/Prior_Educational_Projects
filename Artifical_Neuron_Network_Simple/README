This Python script demonstrates a very simple, manually constructed neural-network–like classifier 
that predicts gender based on physical attributes such as height, weight, eye color, and hair color It uses randomly generated weights and
biases with sigmoid activation functions and repeatedly retries until it correctly classifies a tiny training dataset.

After a “successful” configuration is found, the model is tested on fixed test data and then on completely random input values,
printing all intermediate calculations for transparency and learning purposes.
